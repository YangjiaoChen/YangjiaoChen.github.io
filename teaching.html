I have been fortunate to lead multidisciplinary, cross-functional teams on various R&D projects related to 
3D simulation, self-driving technology, human-in-the-loop driving simulation, human-machine interactions, and multi-modality modeling. 
	    Key projects include:
	    <ul>
<li><b>3D Scenario Generation</b>: Replicated the Midtown Atlanta map to enable realistic simulation environments.</li>
<li><b>Co-simulation for Mixed Traffic in Connected Environments</b>: Developed an integrated platform combining CARLA for autonomous driving simulation, SUMO for traffic simulation, and ns-3 for wireless communication, providing comprehensive, realistic simulation capabilities.</li>
<li><b>HMI Development</b>: Created onboard navigation and warning systems for interactive driving applications.</li>
<li><b>UDP Socket Programming</b>: Implemented efficient data communication protocols to ensure reliable, low-latency data exchange in distributed simulation environments.</li>
<li><b>Autonomous Driving Validation</b>: Designed and implemented strategies for autonomous vehicles in a driving simulator to explore their interactions with human drivers.</li>
<li><b>Multi-modality Modeling</b>: Deployed machine learning models that integrate multimodal data sources (e.g., visual, audio, biometric) to improve accuracy in detecting safety risks, analyzing driver behavior, and monitoring driver states, such as fatigue and distraction. </li>
<li><b>Anomaly Detection for Vehicle Trajectory</b>: Developed machine learning models to identify advanced attacker types and unusual driving patterns.</li>	    
<li><b>Anomaly Detection for CAN-BUS netowrk</b>:Developed deep learning models to detect various attack types for in-vehicle network. </li>
<li><b>Synthetic Data Generation Using Generative AI</b>: Leveraged foundation models to generate realistic and stealthy attack datasets for enhanced testing and validation.</li>
