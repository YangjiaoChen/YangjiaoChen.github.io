I'm a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(179,163,105)">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> 
majoring in <a href="https://prod.ce.gatech.edu/academics/groups/transportation" target="_blank">Transportation Systems Engineering</a> 
supervised by <a href="https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/srinivas-peeta" target="_blank">Dr. Srinivas Peeta</a>.
I earned my M.S. degree in <a href="https://cse.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Computational Science & Engineering </a> from Georgia Tech. 
I received my M.S. degree in <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/Academics/Groups/Transportation" target="_blank">Transportation and Infrastructure Systems Engineering</a> 
from <a href="https://www.purdue.edu" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(194,142,112)">Purdue University</a>, co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=2416" target="_blank">Dr. Samuel Labi</a>
and Dr. Srinivas Peeta. Before that, I received my B.E. degree in <a href="http://en.trans.bjtu.edu.cn" target="_blank">Intelligence Transportation Engineering</a> from <a href="http://en.njtu.edu.cn" target="_blank"  style="color:rgb(77,77,255)">Beijing Jiaotong University</a>.
During my happy undergrad time in Beijing, I spent one semester as an exchange student at <a href="https://umd.edu" target="_blank"  style="color:rgb(255,205,0)">The University of Maryland</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/269/Ali-Haghani" target="_blank">Dr. Ali Haghani</a>.
I was also selected to attend the summer school jointly organized by Tsinghua University and Technische Universität München in 2016.
<br />
<br />
I decided to pursue my Ph.D. because of my interest in connected, automated, and electrified transportation systems and my desire to make contributions 
	to a safer, more intelligent, and environmentally friendly transportation future. My research interests span cybersecurity, digital twin simulation, network modeling, and human factors.
My dissertation focuses primarily on the evolving cybersecurity aspects of the emerging technologies of connectivity and automation in transportation systems. Besides, during the past years in the <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/actlab/" target="_blank">Autonomous & Connected Transportation (ACT) Lab</a>, I have been actively involved in the design and implementation of driving simulator experiments.
These uniquely designed experiments aim to explore the psychophysiological impacts of real-time information on driver cognition in inherently multitasking congested driving environments, 
	driver takeover behavior under Level 3 vehicular automation, 
	the impacts of the built environment design on the adoption of autonomous vehicles,
	and the human driver behavior in mixed-flow traffic with connected and autonomous vehicles. 

<br />
<br />
Outside of my academic activities, I am honored to get elected as the 2020-2021 President of the <a href="https://ite.ce.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) </a> Georgia Tech Student Chapter, 
and the 2020-2021 Vice President of the <a href="https://georgia.ashe.pro" target="_blank">American Society of Highway Engineers Student Chapter (ASHE) </a> Georgia Tech Student Chapter. 
In those capacities, I led the student activities at Georgia Tech and proactively helped students connect with both academic and industry professionals.
