     <li>Dance: I started to learn Chinese dance when I was five years old and achieved a semi-professional level. 
  I was selected to join the Art Troupe at Beijing Jiaotong University and participated in various dance performances and competitions.(<a href="https:">video</a>)
I was also a member of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Team for the School of Traffic and Transportation. Our team was the champion for 2014. (<a href="https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XODM1MzUxMzY0.html?playMode=pugv&frommaciku=1">video</a>)
