<p>While I am trained in engineering and science, I have always been interested in various forms of art, cultures, and history. I have a wide range of hobbies and enjoy visiting museums and galleries. 
  Some of my long-standing passions include: </p>

      <b style="color:rgb(163,194,194)">Calligraphy</b><br />
      <p> I was introduced to Chinese calligraphy at the age of five and have since won several prizes in Sichuan Province. 
        Practicing calligraphy has taught me focus and observation skills. It also serves as a calming practice, allowing me to temporarily set aside other concerns.</p>

      <p>I am an amateur guitarist, having first learned to play during junior high school and rediscovering my passion for it on snowy days in the Midwest cornfields. 
        I enjoy both Eastern and Western instruments, as well as a variety of musical genres.

      <p> China is home to 56 officially recognized ethnic groups. I was introduced to Chinese ethnic dance around the same time I began learning calligraphy, ultimately achieving a semi-professional level (Grade 11). 
        I was a member of the <a  href="https://news.bjtu.edu.cn/info/1044/21400.htm"> Art Troupe</a> at Beijing Jiaotong University. Below are some performance clips：

<p>I'm also passionate about outdoor activities, particularly sports such as swimming, diving, skating, skiing, and skateboarding. 
  I was a member of the <a href="https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XODM1MzUxMzY0.html?playMode=pugv&frommaciku=1">Rhythmic Gymnastics</a> Team at Beijing Jiaotong University.</p>

<p>Beyond arts and sports, I enjoy traveling and have a keen interest in languages. 
  During my undergraduate studies, I took courses in French, German, Japanese, and Portuguese. 
  Inspired by the Chinese saying, “Read ten thousand books and walk ten thousand miles (讀萬卷書, 行萬里路),” I’m always excited to explore new worlds. </p>
