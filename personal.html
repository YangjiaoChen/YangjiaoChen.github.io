I have a wide range of hobbies and enjoy museums and galleries. The following are the ones that accompanied me for a long time:

     <li>Chinese Dance: I started to learn it when I was five years old and achieved a semi-professional level. 
  I was selected to join the Art Troupe at Beijing Jiaotong University and participated in various dance performances and competitions (<a href="https:">video</a>).
I was also a member of the <a href="https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XODM1MzUxMzY0.html?playMode=pugv&frommaciku=1">Rhythmic Gymnastics</a> Team.

      <li>Chinese Calligraphy: It is a perfect way for me to learn how to calm down and focus. 
        I used to be a semi-professional in Sichuan Province and won several prizes.

I am a fan of outdoor activities and interested in sports such as swimming, diving, skating, skiing, and skateboarding.  
<br />
Other than arts and sports, I also enjoy traveling and cooking.
