<p>I have a wide range of hobbies and enjoy museums and galleries. 
  The following are the hobbies that have accompanied me for a long time: </p>
  
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <img src="imgs/dance.jpg"  width="200"
         height="120" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px" >

  <div class="col-md-6">
      <br />
      <b style="color:rgb(128,191,255)">Chinese Dance</b><br />
      <p> I started to learn it when I was five years old and achieved a semi-professional level. 
  I was selected to join the Art Troupe at Beijing Jiaotong University and participated in various dance performances and competitions (<a href="https:">video</a>).
I was also a member of the <a href="https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XODM1MzUxMzY0.html?playMode=pugv&frommaciku=1">Rhythmic Gymnastics</a> Team.

  <div class="col-md-3">
    <img src="imgs/calligraphy.jpg"  width="200"
         height="100" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px" >  
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
      <br />
      <b style="color:rgb(163,194,194)">Chinese Calligraphy</b><br />
      <p> I got exposed to this at the same time when I started to learn Chinese Dance. 
        I used to win several prizes in Sichuan Province. It was a perfect way for me to learn how to observe and focus. 
        Practicing calligraphy can calm me down and I can get rid of other things momentarily.</p>

      <p>I am an amateur üé∏ player. I learned how to play it during my Junior High and recollected during the ‚ùÑÔ∏è days in the midwest cornfield.

<p>I am a fan of outdoor activities and interested in sports such as swimming, diving, skating, skiing, and skateboarding.  
Other than arts and sports, I also enjoy traveling and cooking. </p>
